Generate and export diceware passwords to LastPass


This program generates a random password using the files wordlist4.txt and wordlist5.txt.
Password is generated by 'rolling' a die either 4 or 5 times to generate an index that is
associated with a word in one of the two lists. For passwords of length 4, each word 
requires 4 rolls (example index: 1234). For passwords of length 5, each word requires 5 rolls 
(example index: 12345). Hence either 16 or 25 random numbers are required. The password is 
then saved to password.out. Additionally, using lastpass-cli, passwords generated by this 
script can be exported directly to your lastpass vault.

The rolls are generated by pulling qunatum random numbers from a QRNG API url, namely 
"http://qrng.ethz.ch/api/randint". This is a QRNG from ETH Zurich. Either 4 or 5 calls are
made to the API depending on the number of rolls you choose (each call pulls 4 or 5 random
numbers to create an index of length 4 or 5). More details regarding their approach can be 
found here: http://qrng.ethz.ch. A paper descriping QRNG can be found at https://arxiv.org/pdf/1311.4547
and I have found it to be an excellent source for understanding the topic.

Note: This code can be easily extended to generate longer, higher entropy passwords, if 
a list of words has the correct indexing. Further development may include robustness for 
all types of indicies. Additionally reducing the API calls to 1 per run may be possible.


## Setup Instructions

1. Open a Linux enviornment and navigate to the folder where you wish to install the program. 


2. Run diceware_install.sh with:
    ```bash
    wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kevweiss/diceware/main/diceware_install.sh | bash
    ```
   This will install the command line tool 'diceware_gen' and it's dependancies.
